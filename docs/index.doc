# Setup

## Requirements:
 
AirtimeSignup G2 runs on Python 2.7 and uses pip and virtualenv to manage packages. Please refer to your distributions reference to learn how to install python2.7 and pip. Once you have pip installed you can do:

  pip install virtualenv

To install virtualenv

## Setting up

Navigate to the main directory of this checkout or whereever you zipped the package and run:


 virtualenv .
 source bin/activate
 (v)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Please make sure to run all commands prefixed "(v)$" from within the virtual environment .

Now you have all packages installed in the virtual environment to run the app server. 

## Configure the database

The database can be configured by changing the DATABASE_URL in `airtimesignup/config.y` to the desired URL. AirtimeSignup uses sqlalchemy, which supports many different SQL database backends. In order to understand what configuration is needed for your setup please refer to link::http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/config.html.

Once the database URL is configured please run (within your virtual environment)
 
 (v)$ alembic upgrade head

To upgrade the schema to the latest version

## Running the Dev Server

If you run

 (v)$ python app.py

you should be able to see your website at "http://127.0.0.1:5000/".

## Troubleshooting:


### When running `python app.py` it fails with a Traceback

If you see this

	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "app.py", line 1, in <module>
	    from airtimesignup.app import app
	  File "/Users/benjaminkampmann/dev/airtime-signup-g2/airtimesignup/app.py", line 2, in <module>
	    from flask import (Flask, render_template, jsonify, request,
	ImportError: No module named flask

when running the app, it means your virtual environment has not been configured properly. Make sure you are running it from within the virtual environment by running `source bin/activate` and if it still doesn't work, re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
